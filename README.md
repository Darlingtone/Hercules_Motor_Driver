<br>
Hercules Dual 15A 6-20V Motor Controller is a high current motor drive control board. including micro controller processor, motor drive circuit, charging circuit and protection circuit. It features a complete solution to power supply, control and drive.
 
Compared with L298, its half bridge motor controller IR2104 and N-MOSFET take prominent advantage to drive heavy load device with output current even up to 15A. Hercules Dual motor controller is wide power supply designed, so the universal 7.4~11.1V lipo battery in the remote car and model airplane can be applied as well. Fuse will protect the board while overloaded, the correspondent LED show the protection status.
 
This motor controller is Arduino compatible. Best of all, it is focusing on high- expansion. The reserved standard Grove ports bring you a convenient access to abundant modules on the platform of motor car, such as Servo and Encoder, thus it embraces multi-functions that you can build up versatile masterpieces.

*Features*

- Full bridge drive circuit based on MOSFET supports two independent channelsï¼Œ each channel up to 15A
- LED shows fuse protection status
- Several Grove ports, conveniently connect with servo, encoder and sensors
- Atmege328 controller, Arduino compatible
